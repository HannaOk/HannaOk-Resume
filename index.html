        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ’¼</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Hanna Ok. I was born in South Korea and immigrated to the United States with my family when I was in seventh grade. Despite the language barriers, academic struggles, and other obstacles of adjusting to this new country, I persevered through these challenges and never gave up on my dream. Since I had a desire to become an expert in speaking and writing English, I took many challenging English courses to improve my second language ability. After four years of hard work, I graduated from Cypress High School last year. I graduated with the Academic Honors GPA 3.5+, Perfect Attendance Awards, and Golden State Seal of Biliteracy. I couldn't have done it without the support of my family and teachers. I am currently a first year Pre-Business student attending the University of California Riverside to pursue a Masters of Business Administration in Marketing. During the first half of the year in college, I have worked hard and put in endless effort to achieve my personal goals and to strive in my academic journey. I have always been passionate about improving myself, helping other people, and exploring new knowledge and skills. I also have helped many peers with solving difficult problems and I have invested my time and effort to offer solutions to their circumstances. I want my four years of education to be used for the good of the society. Unfortunately, there are still many pressing world issues, including poverty, climate crisis, and global health issues. By furthering my education in Business, I want to make a difference, gain a foundation in many aspects of the business world, and find opportunities to help enhance my business knowledge and experience. In one of my business classes that I have taken, the two terms that I still remember are "Economic model of social responsibility" and "Socioeconomic model of social responsibility." The first term refers to the view that society will benefit most when business is left alone to produce. In contrast, the second term refers to the idea that business should emphasize not only profits but also the impact of decisions on society. I dream of being a business owner who makes decisions based on the impact on the communities. My goal is to earn an MBA with a concentration in marketing, and I am looking forward to working in advertising and sales departments of companies. I am dedicated in making professional accomplishments and building connections with different employees. Although I still have many steps left to take in order to reach my goal, I want to take my responsibility as a full time student, and do my best in every circumstance. <br><br>

        I am interested in further expanding my knowledge in marketing and I am open to different opportunities and experiences to help me grow professionally. I aim to pursue a career in the field of Business, where I can show my ability to work under pressure and work with diverse people. I excel when working in collaborative groups to complete the project. Since I have experience in serving as a Global Awareness Campaign leader, I am confident in my ability to successfully lead the group, encourage active group involvement, and value every group member's ideas. I was in charge of helping my group to make a short commercial, PSA poster, and an article to spread awareness about global pressing issues. By doing so, I grew my passion in raising awareness and informing people about the current issues that should be taken care of. I want to continue to motivate and inspire people to take actions to help solve the problems. That way, we all can come together to make a better society. I believe that my leadership experience taught me the importance of understanding the teams' strengths, weaknesses, and motivations, and setting expectations for the group. I learned that good teamwork fosters creativity, promotes workplace synergy, provides improved productivity, and helps to come up with a compromised solution. With my responsibility and enthusiasm towards Business, I look forward to making an improvement in our communities and being part of the solution. Also, by concentrating in marketing, I want to help consumers make good lifestyle decisions and develop more awareness of what the company offers. I have a strong interest in offering products or services that have value to the consumers. While working in the career, I want to learn from other people's business insights and endeavours. With the increase in world trade and globalization across the different countries, today's businesses play an important role in helping create innovations and advancements. I am willing to be a part of the community that supports reducing the burdens of minorities and making a better environment for them to live. I want to work not only for my benefits, but for the improvement of people living in the underdeveloped communities. At the University of California, Riverside, I learned the importance of applying marketing and management techniques to business strategies from a variety of classes I have taken. After watching my dad run a business when I was at a young age, I knew I also wanted to go into the field of business. From visiting my dad's workplace, I got inspired by how the employees work hard for the company they are involved in. I got fascinated by the idea of how business operates. During my college years, I hope to intern in an online marketing department in the near future. With an internship, I want to gain valuable experience of working with different people. By doing so, I want to develop my professional aptitude, give myself the broadest spectrum of opportunity when applying for a job after college, and help myself prepare for the real world experience. I am so excited for my next journey, and I am ready to explore my potential. One of my hobbies that contributed to my enhancement of knowledge is watching Ted Talks. During free time, I like watching interesting Ted Talks and learning something fresh and new. I always learn something from listening to the influential speakers, and it gives me a motivational boost while studying.   <br><br>

        With my experience in taking Graphics Communications, I have collaborated with my group members to complete the packaging and branding project. Since I enjoyed making my own brand, designing my own company logo, and using photoshop to make business cards, I got more interested in learning more about marketing strategies. Because I love working in teams to develop creative ideas and giving presentations about the products, I discovered that I am a right fit for this career. By furthering my education in Business, I can work towards my career goals and make a difference with my enthusiasm towards volunteering, contributing to change, and supporting communities suffering from financial crises. It became evident through my volunteer experiences that business is the vehicle through which I can give back to my community and contribute to change. I also want to position myself for diverse professional opportunities throughout my career. As much as I care about minorities' lives, I have actively participated in a variety of volunteer activities such as going on missions, volunteering in the homeless community, and serving food to people who don't have enough money to buy it. I have been engaged in many organizations to support other people's lives and give courage to them. My unique volunteer experience gave me a passion and motivation to pursue my education in Business. I am looking forward to working for a company that has a mission to improve minorities' lives and give donations to underdeveloped countries. Further, I hope to become a CEO who can change this society for the better. I believe that it's our generations' responsibility to work to reduce these world's problems. I strongly believe that by growing expertise, getting certified in my field, and investing in my learning, I can help solve more problems with my acquired knowledge. I want to get involved in making important business decisions and solve problems that might be a threat to a company. I am eager to show my ability, explore more of the business world, and encourage business ethics for companies. I am genuinely excited to explore my potential as a student, and I am truly looking forward to devoting myself into helping others to live better lives. Thank you so much for taking your time to read my bio, and thank you for your consideration.
